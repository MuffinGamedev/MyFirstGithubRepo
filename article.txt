[REDACTED] is a brewed drink prepared from roasted [REDACTED] beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus
[REDACTED] is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros,
Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. [REDACTED] plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C.
arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, [REDACTED] berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried [REDACTED] seeds (referred to as
"beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with
near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as [REDACTED].

[REDACTED] is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways
(e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced [REDACTED] is a popular alternative.

Clinical studies indicate that moderate [REDACTED] consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing
research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are generally
of poor quality.

[REDACTED]

While [REDACTED] is native to Ethiopia and Sudan, the earliest credible evidence of [REDACTED]-drinking as the modern beverage
appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines. It was in what is now
Yemen that [REDACTED] seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking. But the
[REDACTED] seeds had to be first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as [REDACTED] is thought to have been indigenous to the
former. The Yemenis obtained their [REDACTED] via Somali traders from Berbera (who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian
Highlands) and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, the drink had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa.
From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of [REDACTED] beans, producing one-third of the world total. [REDACTED] is a major export
commodity, being the top legal agricultural export for numerous countries. It is one of the most valuable commodities
exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted [REDACTED] is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.
The way developed countries trade [REDACTED] with developing nations has been criticised, as well as the impact on the
environment with regards to the clearing of land for [REDACTED]-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade
and organic [REDACTED] are expanding.
